				<h3>Space Invader</h3>
				<p><img src="images/space-02.jpg" width="500" height="500" /></p>
				<p>Invader&nbsp;(born 1969) is a French&nbsp;urban artist&nbsp;who pastes up characters from and  inspired by the 1978 arcade game&nbsp;<em>Space  Invaders</em>&nbsp;game,  made up of small coloured square mosaic tiles that form a space invader  character mural. He does this in cities across the world, then documents this  as an &quot;Invasion&quot;, with books and maps of where to find each invader. <br />
					Invader is  responsible for perhaps the most recognizable street art stunt of the last  decade. In a planet-wide war of attrition, the pixilated expansionist aliens  from&nbsp;<em>Space Invaders</em>&nbsp;stalked the Earth once more, appearing  everywhere from on the 'Hollywood' letters to  Jacques Chirac's lapel.<br />
					Invader  started this project in 1998 with the invasion of&nbsp;Paris&nbsp;– the city where he lives and the most  invaded city to date – and then spread the invasion to 31 other cities in  France (such as&nbsp;Montpellier,Marseille,&nbsp;Avignon,&nbsp;Rennes,&nbsp;Bordeaux,&nbsp;Lille,&nbsp;Chartres, or&nbsp;Bastia…).&nbsp;London,&nbsp;Cologne,&nbsp;Geneva,&nbsp;Newcastle,&nbsp;Rome,&nbsp;Beanchester,&nbsp;Darlington,&nbsp;Istanbul,&nbsp;Monaco&nbsp;are among the 22 other European cities  which have been invaded. Throughout the world,&nbsp;São Paulo,&nbsp;Los Angeles,&nbsp;New York City,&nbsp;Miami,&nbsp;San Diego,Toronto,&nbsp;Bangkok,&nbsp;Tokyo,&nbsp;Katmandu,&nbsp;Varanasi,&nbsp;Melbourne,&nbsp;Perth&nbsp;and  even&nbsp;Mombasa&nbsp;are now invaded with his colourful  characters in mosaic tiles.<br />
					The mosaics  depict characters from&nbsp;<em>Space  Invaders</em>&nbsp;and other video  games from the early 1980s. The images in these games were made with fairly&nbsp;low-resolution&nbsp;graphics, and are therefore suitable  for reproduction as mosaics, with tiles representing the&nbsp;pixels. The tiles are  difficult to damage and weather-resistant.<br />
				The mosaics are half built in advance. When Invader arrives  in a city he obtains a map and spends at least a week to install them. They are  catalogued, pictured and Invader uses a map indicating their locations within  the city. Typically, mosaics are located 10 to fifteen feet above the ground,  and often on street corners in areas of high visibility.</p>
