				<h3>Banksy</h3>
				<p><img src="images/banksy.jpg" width="500" height="375" /></p>
				<p>Banksy&nbsp;is a pseudonymous England-based&nbsp;graffiti  artist, political activist, film director, and painter.<br />
					His&nbsp;satirical street art&nbsp;and subversive&nbsp;epigrams&nbsp;combine&nbsp;dark humor&nbsp;with&nbsp;graffiti&nbsp;done in a distinctive&nbsp;stenciling&nbsp;technique. Such artistic works of  political and social commentary have been featured on streets, walls, and  bridges of cities throughout the world. <br />
					Banksy's  work was made up of the&nbsp;Bristol underground scene&nbsp;which involved collaborations between  artists and musicians.&nbsp;According  to author and graphic designer Tristan Manco and the book&nbsp;<em>Home Sweet Home</em>, Banksy  &quot;was born in 1974 and raised in Bristol,   England.&nbsp;The son of a photocopier technician,  he trained as a butcher but became involved in graffiti during the great Bristol aerosol boom of  the late 1980s.&nbsp;Observers have  noted that his style is similar to&nbsp;Blek le Rat&nbsp;who began to work with stencils in  1981 in Paris and&nbsp;Jef Aerosol&nbsp;who sprayed his first street stencil  in 1982 in Tours (France), and members of the&nbsp;anarcho-punk&nbsp;band&nbsp;Crass, which maintained a  graffiti stencil campaign on the London Tube System in the late 1970s and early  1980s.&nbsp;However Banksy claims that  he based his work on that of&nbsp;3D&nbsp;from Massive Attack, stating,  &quot;No, I copied 3D from Massive Attack. He can actually draw.&quot; <br />
				Known for  his contempt for the government in labelling graffiti as vandalism, Banksy  displays his art on public surfaces such as walls, even going as far as to  build physical prop pieces. Banksy does not sell photos of street graffiti  directly himself; however, art auctioneers have been known to attempt to sell  his street art on location and leave the problem of its removal in the hands of  the winning bidder. Banksy's first film,&nbsp;<em>Exit Through the Gift Shop</em>, billed as  &quot;the world's first street  art disaster movie,&quot; made its debut at the 2010&nbsp;Sundance Film Festival.&nbsp;The film was released in the UK on  5 March 2010.&nbsp;In January 2011, he  was nominated for the&nbsp;Academy Award for Best Documentary&nbsp;for the film.</p>
