				<h3>Mr. Brainwash</h3>
				<p><img src="images/brainwash-02.jpg" width="500" height="313" /></p>
				<p>Mr. Brainwash&nbsp; often stylized as&nbsp;MBW&nbsp; is the moniker  of Paris-born,&nbsp;Los Angeles based filmmaker and&nbsp;street artist&nbsp;Thierry Guetta. According to the&nbsp;Banksy directed film&nbsp;<em>Exit Through the Gift Shop</em>&nbsp;(2010), Guetta began as a proprietor  of a clothing store and amateur&nbsp;videographer&nbsp;who filmed street artists through the  2000s and &quot;evolved&quot; into an artist in his own right in a matter of  weeks after an off-hand suggestion from Banksy.&nbsp;Guetta was first introduced to street  art by his cousin, the street artist&nbsp;Invader. <br />
					Guetta does  not typically have much physical involvement in the construction of the artwork  attributed to him; he passes ideas to his creative team, mostly graphic  designers who realise the finished pieces. Like his associate&nbsp;Banksy, Guetta employs  famous artistic and historic images, many of which are&nbsp;copyrighted, and amends  the originals in sometimes slight, sometimes significant ways. A number of  critics have observed that his works strongly emulate the styles and concepts  of&nbsp;Banksy, and have  speculated that Guetta is an elaborate prank staged by Banksy who may have  created the works himself. Banksy insists on his official website, however,  that&nbsp;<em>Exit Through the Gift  Shop</em>&nbsp;is authentic and that  Guetta is not part of a prank. <br />
				His work  sold for five-figure sums at his self-financed debut exhibit&nbsp;<em>Life is Beautiful</em>&nbsp;due, it is thought, to a mixture of an  over heated and hyped street art market and according to Banksy and&nbsp;Shepard  Fairey&nbsp;as seen in&nbsp;<em>Exit</em>&nbsp; his misuse of endorsements from  Banksy and Fairey. The exhibit was held in Los Angeles, California,  on June 18, 2008, and was a popular&nbsp;and  critical success. In 2009,&nbsp;Madonna&nbsp;paid  Guetta to design the cover art for her&nbsp;<em>Celebration</em>&nbsp;album. </p>
